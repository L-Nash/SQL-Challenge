# SQL-Challenge 
In this challenge I acted as the data engineer for a new fictional company. I was tasked with gathering information about historical employees. All of the data was contained within six CSV files. 

To start, I prepared an Entity Relationship Diagram to visually describe how the data in each CSV file was related. Using the ERD output as a starting point, I reviewed and modified the code to create tables in PostgreSQL. Once the tables were set up correctly, I imported the data in preparation for the analysis stage. Then, using select statments, sub-queries, etc. I pinpointed answers to specific questions that were posed in the challenge instructions.
